# lockdownLogs : 29th June

1. Woke up 8:30 A.M.
2. Didn't do much studying today
3. I have been too distracted by HRD ministry inability to make a decision
   1. They are leaving us in the dark
   2. Humanity is most scared of uncertainty in life
   3. Which is making us student even more anxious about the exam
4. I know, however much I get ~~stressed~~ about the **fate of the exam** 
nothing will come out of it.
5. I finally, changed the ink in my fountain pen(also did a bit of maintenance)
6. I have been conversing with my old pal. It has stablized my psyche a bit.
7. I have been trying not to think too much about my future(as it's the 
biggest source of ~~depression~~ for me)
8. Not to mention I have been juggling with writing this log and also 
chatting with my pal.
9. Not much else to report, I guess I have been practicing my touch typing 
it has improved a bit.
10. Fin!
