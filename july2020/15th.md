# lockdownLogs : July 15th 

1. Woke up around 8:30 A.M.
2. I watched *Spider-Man Into the Spider-verse*, very nice movie don't how 
I put it off for so long
3. Today I riced the hell out of my pc, It looks awesome now
4. The only thing left is to change into a tiling window manager
5. I'm thinking of switching to the awesome window manager
6. The only real con of switching to linux is not having a very nice music 
player
7. I've maintained a music library of my own, for about 3 years now 
8. Certainly, not a lot of people will go through the hassle of maintaining 
their own music 
9. Spotify, has definitely made music piracy kind of moot
10. It's so easy to listen to any kind of music these days 
11. I'm even willing to stop, just to properly switch to linux
12. The transition to linux has not been easy(**understatement of the 
millenium**)
13. I've gone to back to windows 10 twice now
14. Which is the reason I've missed so many days in the last week
15. I'll stop my rambling here, otherwise we're going to be here a lot longer
16. _Jaa Ne_ (bye in common japanese)
