# lockdownLogs : July 17th

1. Woke up early around 7:30 A.M.
2. On my pal's request we've put our study group on hiatus
3. So not much studying for the past few days
4. Today, I added a lot of cool stuff to my vimrc
5. I want to do cool coding projects
6. But I've been unable to do anything
7. I want to switch to vim fulltime
8. I might be sounding like a broken record at this point
9. What can I say, my environment has been quite tumultuous
10. I suppose this lethargy has to do with the lockdown
11. I don't know, I feel very hollow at the moment
12. Fin!
