# lockdownLogs : July 11th 

1. Woke up around 8:30 A.M.
2. For a change, I did study today (**just a little bit though**)
    1. I did a little bit of organic chemistry
3. I wrote my first shell script (_a very simple one_)
4. I also made a git repo of my config files 
5. I ate a little too much dinner tonight (frankies were tasty)
6. I tried to write c++ in vim 
    1. It's nice but, I can't really debug which is something I need
    2. So for now, I'm gonna write markdown in vim
7. Fin!
