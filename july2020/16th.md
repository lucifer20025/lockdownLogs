# lockdownLogs : July 16th 

1. Woke up around 8:30 A.M.
2. I really didn't do too much today 
3. Today just kind of flew by
4. I've been worried about not doing anything all day
5. I really hate myself for this lethargy
6. I just keep nagging myself for not fulfilling my own ideals 
7. But, maybe I shouldn't so hard on myself. I could be in a much situation
8. If anything I have been using vim a lot these days
9. I really like vim, but I have been hesitant to move to it fulltime
10. Everytime, I write a log, I feel like I'm at a loss for words
11. I just don't know what to ~~write~~ type
12. So, I just end up rambling for ten or so lines 
13. Fin!
