# lockdownLogs : July 1st

1. Woke up super late around 11:45 A.M.
2. Topics I studies today :
   1. Quadratic Equations (**finished**)
   2. Also took a mock test (test-9, ~~I didn't go so well.~~)
3. I realize that I missed yesterday's log. The reason I missed it are below:
   1. I reset my pc, to fix some issue
   2. I had a lot of setup to do
   3. Some of it spilled over to today
4. But now everything's setup just the way I want.
5. I have been haunted by thought about jee cancellation everyday for the past week
6. It really been a constant source of anxiety, rage and other negative emotions
7. Fin!
