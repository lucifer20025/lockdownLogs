# lockdownLogs : July 7th

1. I missed yesterday's log _again);_
   1. I got spooked and switched back to windows 
   2. But nothing was the same anymore
   3. Apart from idm and gaming, linux does everything much better
   4. It comes with c++(gcc) and python build-tools
   5. Anyway, I'll try and stick with pop os for now
2. So the entire day went by just setting up my pc
3. I went outside for bit (to buy some groceries)
4. I haven't yet customized my terminal but, I'm writing this before that so that I don't miss today's log
5. Fin!
