## <a name="about">Why does this exist?</a>

- This exist for multiple reasons including but not limited to:
  - This basically gives an outlet for my internal ramblings
  - This helps me track my ~~life~~ **_~~studies~~_**
  - This also makes me practice markdown (_which is great!_)
  - This may also provide me with catharsis ~~later?~~ in the future
  - This always helps practice typing
  - Anyway, bottom line is that it gives me something to do

## <a name="notes">Additional Notes</a>

- I intend for this to be chronicling my journey through this new world 
under lockdown
  - _Sidenote : my logs only started after lockdown where I live has 
  been lifted for more than 3 weeks_
  - _Another sidenote : although lockdown has been lifted, **Life will 
  never quite be the same anymore**_
- It might just end up being a dud not really something like what I fantasized
- I envisioned of these logs as a kind of bullet journal(not really though)
- I have been logging for a few days now, but I find not a lot remarkable 
enough to log.
- I suppose I can do a better job.
- I have been learning vim
- I have made vim almost like vscode
  - I can open multiple files in tabs
  - I will try to write today's log completely in vim (today is 10th july)
- I also have switched to linux
  - **Distro : Manjaro(xfce)**
  - **Terminal emulator : alacritty**
- **Total days missed : _6_**
